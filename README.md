# Watermarker

## Introduction
Watermarker is a Python application for adding watermarks to images. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for importing images, setting watermark options, and saving the watermarked images.

## Features
- Import main images and watermarks
- Add text watermarks with customizable font, color, and opacity
- Adjust the opacity, size, and spacing of image watermarks
- Save the watermarked image in various formats (JPEG, PNG)

## Prerequisites
Before running this code, you will need:
- A copy of your fonts folder (C:/Windows/Fonts for me) in your project folder inside a directory called fonts (Alternatively, you could point the script at that folder)
- An image in your project folder inside a directory called images with filename placeholder.png

## Dependencies
- tkinter
- Pillow (PIL)
- pathlib

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (`tkinter`, `Pillow`, `pathlib`).
3. Run the script.

## Usage
- Use the "Import Image" and "Import Watermark" buttons to select main images and watermarks.
- Adjust watermark settings, such as opacity, size, and spacing.
- Use text as a watermark by entering text and selecting a font.
- Save the watermarked image using the "Save As" button.
